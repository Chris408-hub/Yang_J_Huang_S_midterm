        <h2>Summer is the best season</h2>
        <p>In my opinion, summer is better than Winter, 
            this argument will consider the advantages of doing activies in summer season.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Going to the beach and swim in the sea</li>
            <li>Wearing shorts & dresses in anywhere </li>
            <li>Doing more ourdoor activies such as going for a run, playing football in the park</li>
            <li>You can be out in the garden until 9pm and the sun is yet to set</li>
            <li>Travel has not many restrictions such as blizzard in summer </li>
            <li>Getting more beneficial physical and mental health</li>
